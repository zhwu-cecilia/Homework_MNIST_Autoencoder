In this homework, we'll implement autoencoders in the context of MNIST. Additionally, as an optional assignment, a similar architecture can be used for a subset of CelebA dataset of celebrity faces.\n"

        "  We've included all the imports necessary for this homework. Please make sure you're running Python 3 with PyTorch (and Torchvision) installed and ready to go, along with NumPy and Matplotlib. Although you might find that these models train a bit faster on GPU, this homework assignment should be doable on most modern laptops. If you're having trouble please let us know ASAP.\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Option 2: Run it online on Google Colaboratory*\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Colab gives access to a GPU, so it could be useful in case you don't have CUDA installed on your computer (**Note: you can use this as an opportunity to get started on GPU training, but we recommend you develop your model and make sure everything works on CPU first**)\n",
        "  - Make a copy of this notebook in your Google Drive folder: \"File\" -> \"Save a copy in Drive...\"\n",
        "  - By default, Colab does not make GPUs available, but you can easily access them by selecting GPU in \"Runtime\" -> \"Change runtime type...\"\n",
        "  - Remember that Colab runs in a temporary virtual machine, so all the data created while running the notebook will be lost at the end of the session, or when the runtime disconnects due to inactivity. To preserve data between sessions, there are a couple of options:\n",
        "    * you can link Colab to your personal Google Drive by mounting it on your runtime, see first cell below.\n",
        "    * you can download/upload files from the Files tab on the right sidebar.\n",

        "**3) How to complete this assignment**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Fill out the relevant code blocks as indicated\n",
        "  - Answer questions by writing them directly in the text block. Please keep your written answers concise, most are meant to be answered in a sentence or two.\n",
        "  - Make figures showing your results and add comments with your observations.\n",

        "**4) Optional exercise: CelebA Data**\n",
        "\n",
        "Whereas MNIST is a toy dataset built into PyTorch, we can also examine a more complex feature space using a subset of 90,000 celebrity portraits from CelebA (see [Liu et al. (2014), \"Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7766)). This is an optional part of the homework, but is a nice way to see how autoencoders perform on other types of visual data. There will be a .zip file of the relevant celebrity faces dataset on the Google Classroom link.\n",

With batch size = 1, training becomes fully stochastic, resulting in highly noisy gradient updates and unstable training. With batch size equal to the entire training set, the gradient is exact but updates are infrequent and computationally expensive, which may reduce generalization performance.\n",
